                <p>My name is Choo Jek Bao. I'm a software developer. I enjoy recreational swimming and Latin ballroom
                    dancing. I value the importance of meditation. These activities keep me feeling healthy and lively.
                    I observe the five precepts of Buddhism, and the practice of charity, for living a righteous life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe it's essential to structure self-education after graduating
                    from university, especially while working full-time. To begin, start with daily reading.
                    It's because I find it really easy to get good books covering my topic of interests.

                    Another approach, for software developer particularly, is doing loads of side projects. In my
                    opinion, learning/sharpening a (new) skill is to practice, practice, and practice.

                    All in all, it's good to develop the habit of reading and writing regularly.
                </p>
